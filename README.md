<h1>Examples of Data Structures Using PHP</h1>

These are small files with data structures, search methods, or techniques used during a programmer's learning process.

I must clarify that I do not recommend the use of my examples to solve real problems, but to understand how to use them in a set of solutions that solve real problems.

All code written in these files has been made by me, but the origin of this knowledge comes from different sources of knowledge.
